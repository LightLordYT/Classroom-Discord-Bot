# About

The Classroom Bot is a bot that is being developed by LightLord in order to update post-notify automatically when there is a new post on google classroom. The Classroom bot will also have many other features including the ability to do assignments and turn in assignments, all from Discord! As the bot grows, more features will be made available, such as reaction roles and more!
